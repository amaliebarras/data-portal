My take on the design of JKAN - lightweight, a backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll. Learn more in the original .readme [here](https://github.com/timwis/jkan/blob/gh-pages/README.md). 

And check out the [existing design](https://open-austin.org/data-portal)

## Core Purpose of Site

Enable folks to learn about, discover, and post links to open data.

## User Testing:

Notes on similar platform from [Code for America Regional Data Portal Webinar](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NF_dlY0I9zjSv_ypjEmztj9thqcB-QeTVdmAMp8JwvM/edit#slide=id.g1119e0a0ca_1_62)

1. "It's tough to know where to start as a data user"
    * Overwhelm homepage with newb stuff
    * Trim down categories for data explorer
    * Distinct flows for posting & getting

2. "It's challenging to explain scientific data to non-scientists"
    * State purpose of collection
    * Explain what the metadata means
    * Suggest usage

3. "It's difficult to download an entire dataset and make it useful"
    * Give examples of use
    * Encourage documentation & walkthroughs
    * Encourage guest lectures at meetups

## SWOT
* Strengths
    * Streamlined
    * Simple
    * Lightweight
* Weaknesses
    * Unwelcoming
    * Assumes prior knowledge
    * Doesn't demonstrate value
* Opportunities
    * Welcome users
    * Demonstrate value of open data
    * Help with projects
* Threats
    * Legal issues
    * Complexity 
    * Scope Creep

## Design Challenge:

Make the data portal newbie friendly without disrupting the flow of existing users.

Make the design modular so that other cities can fork & replace our content.
